# Melynx

> **Domain-specific programming language for pipelines, signals, data engineering, and AI workflows**

---

Melynx is a modern, domain-specific language (DSL) designed to express, compose, and automate pipelines in scientific signal processing, data engineering, and artificial intelligence.  
It is the scripting and orchestration backbone for the MerLab ecosystem‚Äîintegrating seamlessly with [MerLabCore](https://github.com/your-org/merlabcore), [StackFlow](https://github.com/your-org/stackflow), and [FlowScope](https://github.com/your-org/flowscope).

## ‚ú® **Key Features (Planned & In Progress)**

- **Pipeline Definition:**  
  Simple, expressive syntax for building and managing complex data and signal processing pipelines.

- **Signal & Data Processing:**  
  Built-in primitives for temporal signals, time series, batch and streaming data, and domain-specific operations.

- **AI & Machine Learning Integration:**  
  Native constructs for defining, training, and deploying ML/AI workflows (roadmap).

- **Composable & Modular:**  
  Functions, operators, and macros for reusable workflow components.

- **Orchestration & Automation:**  
  Control of execution, scheduling, monitoring, and error handling within pipelines.

- **Seamless Integration:**  
  Designed for deep interoperability with MerLabCore (processing), StackFlow (backend), and FlowScope (visualization).
